There are several test design techniques that are commonly used by Quality Assurance Engineers. The most common ones
are:

1. Equivalence Partitioning: This technique involves dividing input data into groups that are expected to behave in the
   same way. Each group is then tested with a representative test case.

2. Boundary Value Analysis: This technique involves testing input data that is at the boundaries of the input domain.
   This is done to ensure that the software behaves correctly when it receives input that is at the edge of its
   capabilities.

3. Decision Table Testing: This technique involves creating a table that lists all possible combinations of input
   conditions and their corresponding actions. This is useful for testing complex business rules and logic.

4. State Transition Testing: This technique involves testing the behavior of a system as it moves from one state to
   another. This is useful for testing systems that have a complex state model.

5. Pairwise Testing: This technique involves selecting a set of input combinations that cover all pairs of input
   parameters. This is useful for reducing the number of test cases required while still providing good test coverage.

6. Exploratory Testing: This technique involves testing the software without a predefined test plan. Testers use their
   knowledge and experience to explore the software and identify defects.

7. User Acceptance Testing: This technique involves testing the software from the end-user's perspective. Users are
   given scenarios to test and provide feedback on the software's usability and functionality.

These techniques can be used individually or in combination to design effective test cases that provide good test
coverage and help identify defects early in the software development lifecycle.
